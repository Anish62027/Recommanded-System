# Recommanded-System

Movie Recommender System (TMDb)
A machine learning-based Movie Recommender System leveraging the TMDb dataset to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. This project utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation techniques to enhance the user experience.

🔥 Features
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests movies tailored to user preferences.
Search Functionality: Search movies by name, genre, or keywords.
Dynamic Filtering: Allows filtering by rating, release year, or popularity.
Interactive Visualization: Provides insights into user ratings and popular movies.
Scalable Design: Can handle large datasets efficiently.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for implementation.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building and fine-tuning recommendation models.
TMDb API: For fetching movie metadata and images.
Streamlit: To create a user-friendly web interface.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing data trends.

🌟 How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses TMDb movie data.
Model Building:
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends similar movies using metadata.
Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on user interactions.
Hybrid Approach: Combines both techniques for better accuracy.
User Interaction: Users input preferences through the UI, and the system provides movie suggestions.
🧩 Future Enhancements
Integration with other APIs like IMDb for extended metadata.
Add user login and profile features for persistent recommendations.
Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
Implement multilingual support for a global audience.
