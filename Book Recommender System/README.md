# Book Recommender System

This project builds a **Book Recommender System** that suggests books to users based on two different recommendation techniques:

1. **Popularity-Based Recommender System**: Recommends the most popular books based on overall ratings and the number of reviews.
2. **Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommender System**: Suggests books based on user interaction and preferences by finding similar users.

---

## 🔥 Features

- **Popularity-Based Recommendations**: Suggests the most popular books in the dataset.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user behavior data to recommend books that similar users liked.
- **Search and Filter Options**: Allows users to search for books by title, author, genre, and rating.
- **Interactive UI**: A web-based interface that allows users to get book recommendations instantly.
- **Data Visualization**: Shows trends like book ratings, most reviewed books, and popular genres.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for the implementation of the recommender system.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the collaborative filtering algorithm.
- **Streamlit**: To create an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data like book ratings and popularity.
- **SQLite**: For managing the book data (if applicable).

## 🌟 How It Works

### 1. **Popularity-Based Recommender System**:
   - The system ranks books based on their overall popularity (e.g., total ratings, number of reviews).
   - It recommends books that have received the highest engagement from all users, regardless of the individual user's preferences.

### 2. **Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommender System**:
   - **User-Item Matrix**: The system builds a matrix of user ratings for books.
   - **Similarity Calculation**: Finds users with similar rating patterns and recommends books that those users liked but the current user hasn't seen.
   - **Matrix Factorization**: Uses algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to provide recommendations based on the similarity between users.

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

- Add hybrid recommendation systems combining both methods for better accuracy.
- Implement content-based filtering to recommend books based on book attributes (e.g., genre, author).
- Add user profile and login functionality to track reading history and preferences.
- Deploy the app on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) for global access.
