# Movie Recommender System (TMDb)

A machine learning-based **Movie Recommender System** leveraging the TMDb dataset to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. This project utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation techniques to enhance the user experience. 

---

## 🔥 Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests movies tailored to user preferences.
- **Search Functionality**: Search movies by name, genre, or keywords.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Allows filtering by rating, release year, or popularity.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides insights into user ratings and popular movies.
- **Scalable Design**: Can handle large datasets efficiently.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and fine-tuning recommendation models.
- **TMDb API**: For fetching movie metadata and images.
- **Streamlit**: To create a user-friendly web interface.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For visualizing data trends.

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anish62027/Recommanded-System.git
   cd "Movie Recommender System TMBD"
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install the required Python libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Launch the application locally using Streamlit.
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🌟 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses TMDb movie data.
2. **Model Building**:
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends similar movies using metadata.
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on user interactions.
   - **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both techniques for better accuracy.
3. **User Interaction**: Users input preferences through the UI, and the system provides movie suggestions.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

- Integration with other APIs like IMDb for extended metadata.
- Add user login and profile features for persistent recommendations.
- Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- Implement multilingual support for a global audience.
